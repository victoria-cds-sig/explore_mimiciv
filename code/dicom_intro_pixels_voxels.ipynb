In a typical color photograph you would have three numeric values representing the amount of **R**ed, **G**reen, and **B**lue (RGB) at the pixel. A standard MRI or CT image, like those shown above, have a single vaue at each voxel, as do typical X-ray and ultrasound (US) images.

    "\n",
    "The meaning of of the numeric values in a pixel or voxel depends on the imaging modality modality used. In general the voxel values don't have an intrinsic (absolute) value. Rather they are relative to each other. A bright voxel in a particular image has a higher value than a darker voxel in the same image. But in general we can't compare the numeric values between two images. CT is an exception to this that we will address later.\n",

    "X-ray images depict the amount X-rays are attenuated by your body. Dense materials like your bones attenuate X-rays more than say the air in your lungs. So in an X-ray image, bones appear bright and lungs appear dark. (This is the inverse of the image detection process.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultrasound depicts echos of sound waves within your body. The brighter the voxel the stronger the echo. This occurs at boundaries between different tissue types, for example between water and muscle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The voxel values in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are determined by complex physical processes, but you can think of them as depicting various aspects of the local chemical environment of the water (usually) in your body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclear medicine like positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measure the amount of radioactivity from tracers that are injected into your body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computed tomography uses X-rays and so is measuring X-ray attenuation, but emits and detects the x-rays at multiple angles around your body and then uses mathematics to reconstruct what the plane/slice (Greek *tomo*) that all the X-rays passed through.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general you can assume that pixel/voxel numeric values in a medical image have meaning only relative to other pixel/voxel values within the same image. CT is an exception and we will discuss this next.\n",
